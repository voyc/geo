bug:
when globe is upside down, 
	up/down mouse dragging movement is opposite of globe spin

note:
in our data, E and N are positive
in our projection code, E and S are positive
we need to flip Latitude sign, where do we do that?

bug in spin after drag


land: iterateCollection, passing iterateeLand which is derived from polygonclipping
rivers: iterateCollection, passing iterateeRiver, derived from Line

after resize, recalc the point overlap threshold as percentage of diagonal distance of container div
	width by height, a2 + b2 = c2, root of sum of the squares
	gives length of diagonal
	one point is identical to another
	when points are overlaid, is it the same point or a different one?
	1% of the diagonal
	100 x 100, diagonal=130, 1%=1.3
	1000 x 1000, diagonal=1300, 1%=13
	!! dont bother with this now


x block all mouse/touch attach except new hud stuff
	x reorg attachments with single point on/off

attach/connect hud/publish to world and sketch
	x sketch touch
	sketch mouse
	sketch buttons
	world touch
	world mouse
	world buttons

replace sketch addPoint(pt) with addCoord(co), call invert() from Hud (or sketch?)
in sketch draw(), call project() for each point





rename geosketch:geo, sketchpad:sketch
	rename repository
	recreate subdomain
	keep two files named sketch: one in jslib, one in geo, or rename one of them to draw or pad
	what about letting the future of voyc dovetail into geo, global
	geo.voyc.com
	global.voyc.com - to be folded into geo
	let geosketch be the authoring tool for global and plunder
	rename geo to GeoMath or GeoLib
element pad has no purpose. remove id, or rename to "container"

- sketch upgrade
	- each object must be a discrete event, with points, size, color, name, begin, end
	- multipolygon?
	 -after drawing, object must become part of map and move along with it
	 - save objects
	 - create layers
	 - make a layer the currently edited one, save objects into chosen layer

- Drawing upgrades
	- Palettes
	- Line drawing by palette or alt key
	- Line is one side of a polygon
	- Fill
	- Mask land
	- mask water

- edit map layers
- create new custom layers
